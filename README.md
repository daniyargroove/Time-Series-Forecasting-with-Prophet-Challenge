# Time-Series-Forecasting-with-Prophet-Challenge

In a bid to drive revenue, I produced a Jupyter notebook that contains my data preparation, analysis, and my visualizations for all the time series data that the company needs to understand. I used text and comments to document findings. And, I answered the question prompts in the instructions. Specifically, this notebook contains the following:

Visual depictions of seasonality (as measured by Google Search traffic) that are of interest to the company.

An evaluation of how the company stock price correlates to its Google Search traffic.

A Prophet forecast model that can predict hourly user search traffic.

Answers to the questions in the instructions that I wrote in my Jupyter notebook.

(Optional) A plot of a forecast for the company’s future revenue.

Make sure to also create a MarkdownREADME.md file that summarizes your models and findings.

Instructions
First, I configured a Google Colaboratory, or Colab, workspace as follows:

Open Google ColabLinks to an external site, and then uploaded my starter notebook.

Ran the provided code in the “Install and import the required libraries and dependencies” section. Note the following:

The first cell installs the necessary libraries into the Google Colab runtime.

The second cell imports the dependencies for use in the notebook.

With my workspace configured, I could begin the Challenge. The instructions are divided into four steps and an optional fifth step as follows:

Step 1: Find unusual patterns in hourly Google Search traffic.

Step 2: Mine the search traffic data for seasonality.

Step 3: Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns.

Step 4: Create a time series model by using Prophet.

Step 5 (optional): Forecast the revenue by using time series models.
